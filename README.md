Just the grammar files extracted from [atom-typescript](https://github.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript) so they can easily be used with Atom's [Highlights](https://github.com/atom/highlights) syntax highlighter.

The grammar files were copied manually from https://github.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript/tree/master/grammars, which is not the most sustainable route but I don't expect them to change very often.
